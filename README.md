## Stickman Sprint
### A little History
Originally this was intended to be an endless runner game but some issues with collision detection arose and so I moved on from there to make a hangman game which also ended up not working.
However, Both games then gave me the idea for a rock, paper, scissors game which is exactly what this is. (Code is still present for hangman and the endless runner but have been disabled for now due to them not fully working.)

### How To Play
It simple enough on the ordinary levels all you have to do is make a choice of the pictures presented in front of you. Starting at 3 pictures but this game moves all the way up to 7.
A score is tallied based on what rounds you win and lose, draws do not affect your score.
On the boss levels however its a bit tougher because all your options are unknown to you and appear in different orders between levels. In order to make it to the end of the game with a decent score you'll have to learn quickly which picture is what.
I hope you enjoy this game regardless
